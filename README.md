# Dating Rare Mutations from Small Samples with Dense Marker Data

## Online analysis

This application estimates the age of a genetic mutation, given the known genetic length of ancestral haplotypes common to individuals who share the mutation. Mutation age estimation from can now be performed with an R shiny tool that implements the previous R code (below) with a user friendly GUI found at:

## R Script Usage

An R script is provided for the estimation of mutation age, with a usage example. Documentation can be found [here](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/software/ageofmutation/Documentation.pdf).
